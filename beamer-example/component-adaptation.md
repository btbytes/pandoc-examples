# Summary

The main aim of this paper is to contribute to the definition of a methodology
for automatic development  of adaptors, capable of solving behavioural
mismatches.

The main ingredients are:

  a) The inclusion of behavior specifications in component interfaces.
  a) A simple, high-level notation for expressing adaptor specifications.
  a) A fully automated procedure to derive concrete adaptors from given high-level specifications.
